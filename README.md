# Private Program
Private programs are programs that are not published to the public. This means it can only submit vulnerabilities to these programs when you receive a specific invitation to hack them. All vulnerability reports for this program remain confidential, and you cannot explicitly discuss the vulnerabilities you discover.

Because private programs limit the number of hackers invited to the program, the number of report submissions is also limited to allow the program to become accustomed to receiving and prioritizing vulnerability reports. All programs start out as private programs, but as they become more adept at handling reports, they may choose to go public if desired.

The advantage of hacking private programs over public programs is that the number of hackers who find vulnerabilities is much smaller, giving you the advantage of finding and being rewarded for them.
